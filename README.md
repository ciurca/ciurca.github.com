# Project Aggregator

## About

This is a website I made that aggregates all of my Github projects. All the data you see is pulled from an external Google Sheets, and so every time I add something new in that Sheets, it automatically updates the website.

## What it uses

It's using HTML and Bulma for the UI, JavaScript and JQuery for the update functionality.

## DIY

You can fork this project if you also want to do something like this, just make sure you change the Google Sheets URL in the script.js file. (more about the Google Sheets URL [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/cjn-google-sheets-as-json-endpoint/))
